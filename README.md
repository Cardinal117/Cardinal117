## 👨‍💻About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cardinal117
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and pretty much anything tech-related.
- This is just a showcase of my website I am messing around with. I will probably add new things I find fun and funny every so often.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack web development and software engineering.

## 📌Project Description

The project showcases the use of SCSS, HTML, and some JavaScript to create a fresh-looking website with animations that make the website feel alive.

## 💾📂How to Install

1. Download the project files.
2. Locate and double-click the `index.html` file.
3. The website should open in your default web browser, allowing you to see the website and use all of its functions.

### 🛠️Example Pages:
- **The first page should look like this:**

- **The games page should look like this:**

- **The image and text in the box below the Planning and Brainstorming bullet points will change after a few seconds:**
  - **First change:**

  - **Second change:**

## 🚀Usage

- You can browse through each section of the website and use the table of contents to quickly navigate to different sections.
- The buttons at the top of the header/page can be clicked on to navigate to other webpages.

## 🛠️Future Updates

- I will be adding a save-for-later functionality to some sections of the webpages. This will allow you to click on a save-for-later button and view that section on another webpage later.
- I will be adding a page to view your saved-for-later sections of the webpages.
- More animation effects will be added:
  - A chain animation that will link some parts of the code and make them appear chained together with a cool affect.
  - Additional animation effects that will be toggleable via buttons or it will appear in the background.
- A hiding and showing function that will allow users to hide or show sections/all content or just some parts of the webpages.

- 💡Let me know what extra features or effects I should add in the future, I will try my very best to implement it in some way.
